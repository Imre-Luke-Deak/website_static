'R for Data Science'<br>
<i>Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund</i><br><br>

Following my initial deepdive into all the primary tools/languages used in data analysis/science, I immediately gravitated towards R for its statistics-oriented development. After following through several 
YouTube videos detailing the basics of the programme, I discovered this book and used it to learn the fundamentals of R data wrangling, visualisation and coding etiquette from one centralised source 
as opposed to dozens of channels. While some of the syntax is now outdated, this book served me as an excellent resource covering the essential packages in an easily digestible format.

'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts'<br>
<i>Peter Bruce & Andrew Bruce</i><br><br>

While the previous book covered the practical basics of R, it didn't dwell too much in the realm of statistics. 'Practical Statistics for Data Scientists' is an excellent book which is not only oriented for 
R users, but to anyone with a spotty or limited knowledge of statistics - I still find myself returning to this book if I need refresher on a concept or overcomplicate a project. <br><br>

The book covers EDA, data visualisation, sampling distribution, hypothesis/p-value testing and both supervised and unsupervised machine learning (regressions, classification & cluster analysis).
