<h3> Context </h3> <!-- Section 1 -->

<p>

A/B testing is a statistical evaluation of two pre-determined design choices randomly assigned to a pool of users, usually in the context of front-end development and marketing analysis.
The objective of these tests is simply to verify which design choice, if any, leads to improvement in a desired metric, such as click rates, retention or purchases/subscriptions.
It is also possible to analyse more than two design choices (colours of a subscription button) or a chain of independent design choices (<i>colour → size → font</i> of a subscription button), 
though this would be referred to as multivariate analysis. 
        <br><br>
This project aimed to develop my automation skills in the context of an A/B analysis on the significance of a realistic ad campaign (ie. marketing analysis). I have set up several functions which will 
correctly pick out the most appropriate test (more on this later) based on the results of several assumption checks - in order to determine the significance of the ad campaign if the data receives an update.
        <br><br>
Vigorous A/B testing is especially crucial in the context of marketing analysis over classic user interface examples, as rolling out an ad campaign involves significantly higher costs (e.g. planning, 
asset design, potential contracts) than updating a website, therefore making the correct* data-driven decision is particularly vital in order to maximise firm revenue and minimise unnecessary losses.
